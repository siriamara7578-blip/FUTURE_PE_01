## **3. Urgency CTA (Limited Seats)**

**Small Batches = Better Attention**

We keep very small batches so every student gets personal attention.
Because of this, seats fill quickly — especially before exams and new academic year.

We do not overcrowd classes.
Once the batch is full, we cannot add more students.

If you are planning to join, it is better to reserve a seat early.

**Admissions Open Now – Limited Seats Only**
