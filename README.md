## Business Selected
Bright Future Academy – Coaching Institute  
Location: Velachery, Chennai

---

## Problem
Many local coaching institutes have unclear or weak website content.  
Parents and students cannot understand what the institute offers, which reduces admissions and trust.

---

## Solution
I designed a reusable Prompt Engineering system that uses AI to automatically generate professional website copy for local businesses.

The system converts business details into ready-to-use website content.

## What This Project Generates
- Homepage content (headline, introduction, trust points)
- Services page descriptions
- Conversion-focused Call-To-Action sections
- Friendly tone adapted for students and parents

---

## Tools Used
- ChatGPT (AI content generation)
- Prompt Engineering
- GitHub (project hosting)

---

## Prompt Logic
I created structured prompts where:
Business details → AI processing → Website copy output

The prompts instruct the AI to:
- Focus on benefits instead of features
- Use simple human language
- Avoid generic AI text
- Target parents and school students
